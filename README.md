## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./images/qrcode.PNG)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- 



### What I learned

I was a little clean with my codes although had a hard time on the media query, I believe I will do better as I continue,
all were normal semantic html and custom css with a little bit of css grid.




### Continued development

As I continue I will have to work more on github and git flow, also my media query was not what I expected; I had a lot of it trying to make sure it fits to every screen I was able to lay my hands on. I would be happy if someone can tell me more on how to go about media query.



### Useful resources

I didn't go for any resources apart from the cloned materials from frontend mentor but I know I will definitely go with others as I move on
